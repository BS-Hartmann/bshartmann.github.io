I earned earned a Bachelor of Science from the University of Minnesota in 2017 in Sociology and History with minors in Asian American Studies, Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies in the United States, and Statistics. I am currently a doctoral student in the Sociology Department at Indiana University studying race, immigration, political sociology, culture, and quantitative/computational methodology. My work focuses on how individuals make sense of social categorization. By understanding the  schemas through which individuals conceptualize race, I argue sociologists and policy-makers can better understand racial attitude in social surveys and how people make sense of racialized policy and racial justice.   

Furthermore, I am passionate about methodology and methodological education. I am one of the co-coordinators for the Compuatioanl Social Science working group in the Sociology Department at Indiana University and coordinator workshops in statistical software for graduate students. I think about how sociologists can utilize computational lingiustics, quanitative text analysis, network analysis, and machine learning to test social theories and make sense of society. I am currently working on projects on using machine learning to automate coding for social texts (social media posts) and operationalizing ties in discourse/text networks. Additionally, I utilize schematic class/network analysis techniques in my substantive work on conceptualization of race.

I have previously wrote about students access to extracurricular activities in schools, Japanese American baseball players who played professionally in Japan in the 1950s, and the differential impacts of body scrutiny for gender nonconforming/gender conforming adolsences in the Twin Cities. And presented on people perceptions of hireability of GED vs High School graduates and multiracial identity.
